# FAQ:

1. For those facing the issue of "`next` is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."

Run the following command:

```bash

npm install -g next

```

This installs Next.js globally

then do the usual `npm run dev`

# After working on it locally, the steps to pull and push to repo:

git pull origin master

git add .

git commit -m "message"

git push origin master
